Qwen Image Layered was created to revolutionize image editing through AI-powered layer decomposition, making professional image editing accessible to everyone without Photoshop skills. **Qwen Image Layered automatically decomposes any image into editable RGBA layers**.

## What is Qwen Image Layered

**AI-Powered Layer Decomposition:** Qwen Image Layered is an advanced AI model capable of decomposing an image into multiple RGBA layers. This layered representation unlocks **inherent editability** - each layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content.

Qwen Image Layered naturally supports **high-fidelity elementary operations** such as resizing, repositioning, and recoloring. By physically isolating semantic or structural components into distinct layers, Qwen Image Layered enables high-fidelity and consistent editing that was previously only possible with manual Photoshop work.

## Key Features

**Automatic Layer Separation:** Qwen Image Layered AI automatically separates your image into multiple editable layers with transparency. No manual selection or masking needed - Qwen Image Layered does all the work for you.

**Smart Background Reconstruction:** Qwen Image Layered intelligently fills in hidden areas behind objects, creating complete layers ready for editing. This is perfect for object removal and replacement tasks.

**Flexible Layer Control:** Qwen Image Layered supports 3-8+ layers based on image complexity. You can decompose layers recursively with Qwen Image Layered for infinite refinement and precision.

**Easy Editing Operations:** With Qwen Image Layered, resize, recolor, move, or replace objects independently without affecting other layers. High-fidelity editing made simple by Qwen Image Layered.

## Layered Editing in Action

Given an image, Qwen Image Layered can decompose it into several RGBA layers. After decomposition, edits are applied exclusively to the target layer, physically isolating it from the rest of the content, and thereby fundamentally ensuring consistency across edits.

For example, with Qwen Image Layered you can:

- **Recolor objects** - Change the color of any layer while keeping all other content untouched
- **Replace elements** - Replace objects in specific layers (like changing a person from girl to boy)
- **Edit text** - Modify text content in specific layers
- **Delete objects** - Remove unwanted objects cleanly without affecting background
- **Resize without distortion** - Scale objects up or down while maintaining quality
- **Move objects freely** - Reposition any element within the canvas

## Flexible and Iterative Decomposition

Qwen Image Layered is not limited to a fixed number of layers. The model supports variable-layer decomposition. For example, Qwen Image Layered can decompose an image into either 3 or 8 layers as needed, depending on your requirements.

Moreover, decomposition with Qwen Image Layered can be applied recursively: any layer can itself be further decomposed, enabling infinite decomposition possibilities for complex editing tasks.

## Why Qwen Image Layered

**Time-Saving:** Qwen Image Layered completes layer decomposition in 2-5 minutes, compared to 30-60 minutes of manual work in Photoshop.

**Cost-Effective:** Qwen Image Layered is free and open-source (Apache 2.0 license). No subscriptions, no usage limits, and full control over your data.

**Beginner-Friendly:** Qwen Image Layered requires no professional skills - anyone can achieve professional-level image editing results.

**Multiple Layer Output:** Unlike background removal tools that only output one layer, Qwen Image Layered generates multiple RGBA layers with complete background reconstruction.

**Automatic Processing:** Qwen Image Layered handles background reconstruction automatically - no manual painting or editing required.

## Use Cases

Qwen Image Layered is perfect for:

- **E-commerce**: Product photo editing and background replacement
- **Graphic Design**: Quick layer separation for design projects
- **Content Creation**: Easy image manipulation for social media and marketing
- **Photo Editing**: Professional-quality edits without Photoshop expertise
- **Print Design**: Prepare images for various print formats
